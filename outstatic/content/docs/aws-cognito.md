AWS Cognito is a managed service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that facilitates user authentication, authorization, and user management for web and mobile applications. It enables developers to quickly and securely add sign-up, sign-in, and access control features to their apps. Cognito supports user authentication through various methods, including email/password, phone number, and federated identities using social identity providers like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, as well as enterprise identity providers via SAML.

With features like multi-factor authentication (MFA), adaptive authentication, and fine-grained access control, AWS Cognito ensures robust security and compliance. It also includes user pools for managing and storing user profiles, and identity pools for granting users access to other AWS services. By offloading the complexity of building and maintaining authentication systems, AWS Cognito allows developers to focus on developing their core application functionalities while leveraging a scalable and secure user management solution.
