Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) is a cloud-based identity management service provided by Microsoft Azure. It enables developers to integrate secure and scalable authentication and authorization functionalities into their web and mobile applications. Azure AD B2C supports various authentication methods, including local accounts (email and password) and social accounts through identity providers such as Google, Facebook, and Microsoft accounts.

The service offers extensive customization options, allowing developers to tailor the user experience for sign-ups, sign-ins, and profile management to match their brand's look and feel. Azure AD B2C also supports multifactor authentication (MFA) and conditional access policies to enhance security. It integrates seamlessly with other Azure services and provides robust APIs and SDKs for ease of integration. Designed for scalability and reliability, Azure AD B2C is suitable for applications targeting consumer-facing and business-to-consumer (B2C) scenarios, enabling developers to focus on their core application functionality while Azure handles the complexities of identity management and security.
