WorkOS is a platform that provides developers with tools to integrate enterprise-grade features into their applications. It focuses on simplifying the implementation of complex, enterprise-level functionalities such as single sign-on (SSO), directory synchronization, audit logs, and multifactor authentication (MFA). WorkOS supports a wide range of identity providers and directory services, making it easier for applications to connect with corporate IT systems. The platform aims to reduce the development effort required to build and maintain these features, enabling developers to quickly add robust, scalable, and secure enterprise functionalities to their apps. WorkOS is designed to handle the heavy lifting of compliance and security requirements, ensuring that applications can meet the needs of enterprise customers without extensive in-house development.
